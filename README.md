# Shopping App (Practice Project)

This project is a practice app built using Flutter. The primary focus of this app is to learn and understand various Flutter concepts such as theming, state management (using Provider), navigation, layout building, and more. The app does not prioritize advanced UX/UI design but serves as an excellent starting point for learning these Flutter features.

  


## Learning Objectives

This project was created to help the developer get familiar with the following key concepts:

- **Theming:** Learn how to define and apply different themes to customize the app's look and feel.
- **State Management (Provider):** Understand how to manage state across different widgets and pages using the Provider package.
- **Navigation:** Learn how to implement navigation between different screens using Flutter’s Navigator.
- **Layout Builder:** Explore how to build adaptive and flexible layouts with Flutter’s layout widgets (e.g., Column, Row, GridView).
